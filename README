This repo contains information and scripts / artifacts to deploy a test instance of eDelivery component Domibus

If you are interested in learning more head on over here,
https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Domibus

To deploy the component, clone this repo, log in to an openshift environment, like the Dev Sandbox (free signup here, https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox )
Make sure you are in the correct or desired namespace/project.

Then run the script deploy.sh like,
sh ./deploy.sh

The script should output a route where you can access the application, it takes a couple of seconds for it to become ready.

when you are done you can clean up with the following command.
oc delete all,pvc,secret -l app=domibus
